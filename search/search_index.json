Two of the small Burning Cats lie on the ground, no longer in flames, while the remaining two are still engaging the party. A large creature, formed from what appears to be another 22 dead cats, is now present in the room and ready to attack. It is winged and appears to be some sort of Dead Cat Dragon.</p> <p>Evan, still in his Beep Boop form, attempts unsuccessfully to attract the creature's attention, while Gal is still near the man on the hospital bed at the end of the room.</p> <p>During combat, Falsair uses Dimension Door to teleport next to Gal, leaving Meldohr to face the Dragon. Soon after, Meldohr is bitten and goes down.</p> <p>Observing the Dragon, Falsair identifies that the different smaller cats making up this creature are Undead and being held together by some sort of Wild Shape magic.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the figure on the bed is begging Gal to be put out of his misery. When she severs the tubes connecting him to the vats surrounding the bed he screams in pain and both the blue liquid and his blood start leaking out and forming a puddle on the floor. Shortly after she is taken down by the Dragon and is later brought back by Falsair, while Marius helps Meldohr.</p> <p>During combat Nula conjures a Giant Octopus to grapple the Dragon, and Evan takes it down by shooting it between the eyes with an arrow. One of the Burning Cats is still alive, and Meldohr manages to tie it up. Nula tries to pour water on it so it can be put in a bag without burning it up, but this kills it.</p> <p>Once out of combat, Meldohr tries to examines the man's body and figures out that the blue chemical is being used to force magic inside of him while the blood is being removed to use this magic outside of his body.</p> <p>Nula identifies this man as Fengar, a druid who can Wild Shape into a Saber-Toothed Tiger and who is known to be in the same Superhero team as Beep Boop. The party realises that the cat-adjacent fur upstairs is probably Tiger fur and Gal notes that \"Fenny\"\" is probably Fengar.</p> <p>Gal checks the panels near the chemical vats and notices that the lights have all gone off. She makes a sketch of the panel. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the room, Evan, Nula and Meldohr try to pull down the Beep Boop portraits. They are only able to pull one down, ripping out the wires connected behind it. Nula notices that the portrait's eyes are no longer lit up with red light.</p> <p>She then asks the Giant Octopus that she had conjured during the fight to drink some of the chemicals on the floor. It seems to adopt Nula's Star Form. Gal also collects a small amount of the liquid.</p> <p>Falsair uses his necromantic abilities to bring Miss Lucy's cats back. He asks the prettiest one of them to drink up the chemicals, which turns into a shape similar to a Saber-Toothed Tiger and becomes hostile. It is easily killed by Falsair's other cats, but during the fight the chemicals on the floor are set alight, causing half of the room to be on fire.</p> <p>Meldohr tries to retrieve Fengar's body but decides not to step into the flames. </p> <p>The party then returns to the house through the tunnel, trying not to trigger the tripwires. Meldohr snags one with his hammer but manages to get through. Marius also sets a mental alarm on the lab entrance before crossing. The last of Falsair's cats to cross triggers one of the wires with its tail, however nothing happens.</p> <p>Once outside of the tunnel, inside Fenny's Home, Evan checks the back door while Meldohr attempts to discreetly check outside through the upstairs window and fails miserably. He does spot three men at the door wearing blue uniforms, which Falsair identifies as police uniforms.</p> <p>Gal opens the door dramatically, surprising the police officers outside. Their leader screams at her and she tries to defuse the situation by praising them and tempting the leader with the mystery within, however she also angers him by mentioning his wife. he demands the rest of the group come out but she manages to stall them.</p> <p>A few moments laterMarius tries to go speak to them, but the leader grabs him and pulls him out while Nula attempts to deescalate. Falsair comes to the door, frightening the men. Meldohr tries to get the leader to come in but gets yelled at and shuts the door. Marius then uses Calm Emotions on the man and he walks away. The party leaves out of the back door and returns to the agency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Evan has already left out of the back door. He gets back to the agency first and meets Issha who is outside freaking out. Evan goes inside with him, and is led to the second floor where he meets a man with glowing red eyes. He is Beep Boop. He tells Evan that he saw everything through the portraits, and that the party has destroyed a lot of work inside his lab.</p> <p>The party then joins Evan and Beep Boop in the meeting room. Gal offers her hand but he just stares. He tells the party that they have destroyed a valuable resource, and that they will now stay around to do dirty work for him and stay out of his way or be destroyed. The party is then ordered to leave and send Issha in. During this conversation, Nula and Evan notice an engraving on Beep Boop's neck that reads \"Mk 7\" and later reveal this to the rest of the party.</p> <p>Falsair shares his knowledge of the Superheroes, noting that Fengar is known to be more powerful than Beep Boop, and that Beep Boop has six copies designated Mk 1-6, but not Mk 7.</p> <p>The party then decides to find a place to rest and visit the pubs in Barouk District near the agency. They visit a pub called The Blue Bucket, run by an old man named Paul. Evan and Gal make an arrangement with Paul to host a pub quiz in exchange for free drinks for the party, as well as a room for Gal to use as a dressing room. </p> <p>Everyone gets a free drink as a sample and they sit down to drink underneath a taxidermized octopus while Gal goes upstairs to take a bath.</p> <p>Falsair reveals that he has been involved with Beep Boop before, during his past as a supervillain. He explains that he retired after being betrayed by his team, and that he no longer has any contacts in the industry. He also notes that Gal is his great great-great-grandniece (?) and while she knows of his past she was not involved in the trade.</p>"},{"location":"Logs/Session%203/","title":"Session 3","text":"<p>04/11/2023</p> <p>It is Tuesday evening.</p> <p>The party is at the Blue Bucket pub, discussing Falsair's past as a villain, while Gal takes a bath upstairs.
