Located in ? within [[Ondra]], across the street from [[Miss Lucy's Home]].

It is an unremarkable Tudor style house, with doors and gardens at the front and back.

The [[index#Players and Characters|party]] broke in to find [[Miss Lucy]]'s 24 cats, but found the house empty. However, there was a large amount of cat-adjacent fur in the bedroom, while the rest of the house seemed uninhabited. There was a very large metal portrait of [[Beep Boop]] in the living room, covering the entrance to a tunnel.
