Ondra is the initial setting for the campaign. It is a very large city, built on top of a magical spring.
It is run by the Council, led by [[Tenda Jr.]]. 

The city seems to function as a city-state. Around 100 years ago the city was at war with neighbouring cities over the source of magic, until [[Tenda]] harnessed the magic underneath the city to end the conflict. The city now lives in a state of Cold War.

The Council of Ondra developed the idea of "heroes". They work in agencies and are paid to aid residents, partly paid for by clients and partly subsidized by the Council. The most known heroes are called Superheroes (e.g., [[Beep Boop]]). Because neighbouring cities have their own Superheroes, they have become tools of mutual assured destruction.
