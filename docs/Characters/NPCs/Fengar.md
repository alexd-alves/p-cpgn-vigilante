Suspected by the [[index#Players|party]] to be the same person as [[Fenny]].

Fengar is one of [[Ondra]]'s most known [[Ondra#Superheroes|Superheroes]]. He is a Druid and can Wild Shape into a Saber-Toothed Tiger.

He was found by the party in [[Beep Boop]]'s secret lab within [[Fenny's Home]]. He is seemingly unconscious on a hospital bed and is surrounded by large containers of blue chemicals which are being pumped into him. 

He wakes up and begs to be put down, and later dies during the encounter at the lab. His dead body is left there.
