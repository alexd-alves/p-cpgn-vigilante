_**Fire From.**_ The flame cat can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the flame cat or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) fire damage. In addition, the flame cat can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 2 (1d4) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.  
_**Pounce.**_ If the flame cat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the flame cat can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.  
_**Variable Illumination.**_ The flame cat sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The flame cat can alter the radius as a bonus action.  
_**Water Susceptibility.**_ For every 5 feet that the flame cat moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

Wizards, with their spell books, tend to get nervous around flame cats. Unsurprisingly, flame cats love to watch things burn, and spell books have a tendency to go up in flames around them. Because of this, wizards do not summon them very often. Druids that live in the forest also tend to be skittish around flame cats, not wanting their homes burned down. Those druids that live in other environments—such as caves or deserts—frequently summon flame cats, especially when in the forest or when encountering a wizard.

Flame cats stand a little under 3 feet tall, their bodies constantly rippling. Unlike fire elementals, flame cats have a distinctive shape that is always present, no matter how strained that shape might be from a tight corridor.
